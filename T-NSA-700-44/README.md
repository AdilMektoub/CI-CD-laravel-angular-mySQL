A vagrant module for ansible, that lets you control vagrant VMs from an ansible playbook. (BLAH)



--- 
#
# This section fires up a set of instances dynamically using vagrant,
#  registers it in the inventory under 
#  the group "vagrant_hosts"
# then logs in and pokes around. 
#


#
# Run on the vagrant_hosts group, checking that we have basic ssh access...
#    



#    
# Shut them down
